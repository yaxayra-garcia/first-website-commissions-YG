Hello! If you are reading this then that means that for some reason my first commission landed in your hands. </br>
At this time I dont know what a README file is but hopefully I'm doing it right.</br>
This project was assigned to me by a local construction business in Phoenix, AZ. </br>
Even without real social media or internet presence this small company had slowly grown by word of mouth.</br>
I created a very simple website for them with three simple features:</br>
  -  images provided by the company which were then edited and uploaded by me</br>
  -  relevant information about their company including services and contact information</br>
  -  a request estimate form using EmailJS that dirrectly sends an email to the business </br>
  
Although it is easier to use modern resources like wordpress for web development I chose to code everything for this project. </br>
I still have a lot to learn and the website is still not entirely complete but as everything else it will continue to grow along with me.</br>
Feel free to give any tips or completely trash me if you'd like.</br>

-best regards, 
YG
